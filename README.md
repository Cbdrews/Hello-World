# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I have had an incredible interest in learning coding for a very long time.  I'm currently working on my truck farm here in beautiful Knott County KY.  I have a wonderful man in my life, a terrific Australian shepherd mutt and two kitty cats.  Life is good.  Expanding my horizons, and eventually I hope to design websites for fellow entrepreneurs.
